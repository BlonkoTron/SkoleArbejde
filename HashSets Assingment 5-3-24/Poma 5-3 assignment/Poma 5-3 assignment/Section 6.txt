Add Function:

Comparing the add function in with both hashsets and list. 
The results shows that list are faster in this regard since hashsets need to make a hash for the added data.

Contains Function
Here the hashsets were much faster since knowing what is in the hashset it its primary function of not allowing duplicates so it knows
where to find the matching value since of the given Hash

Remove Function.
This function was also faster since the hashset know where each value is in the memory and can remove it almost instantly.
